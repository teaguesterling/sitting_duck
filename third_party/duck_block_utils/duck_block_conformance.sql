-- duck_block conformance checks, PURE SQL -- no duck_block_utils required.
--
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. duck_blocks_validate() ships inside an extension built for a
-- specific DuckDB version, and DuckDB matches extension ABI by EXACT version string.
-- An extension that vendors its own DuckDB submodule pinned off-release reports e.g.
-- 'v1.5.5-dev154' and CANNOT LOAD duck_block_utils by any route -- not INSTALL, not
-- LOAD '<path>', and publishing would not change it.
--
-- Raised by the webbed session, whose metadata blocks carried a NULL level for three
-- major spec versions with nothing in a position to object: the check that would have
-- caught it was one they structurally could not run. If markdown and panduck vendor
-- duckdb too, none of the three consuming extensions could run the validator, which
-- explains a great deal about how long these defects survived.
--
-- So conformance for that class of consumer has to be SHAPE-BASED, not
-- extension-based. Copy this file; it needs nothing but DuckDB.
--
-- It is kept honest by test/check_conformance_macro.py, which runs both these macros
-- and the real duck_blocks_validate() over the same corpus and FAILS if they disagree.
-- Two copies of one rule checked by the same party cannot detect their own
-- disagreement -- this repo shipped exactly that defect in an image's alt text -- so
-- the two implementations are compared rather than merely both maintained.

-- WHAT THIS BUYS YOU, from the panduck session and sharper than the framing above:
-- the value is not "the same checks without a dependency". It is TWO CHECKS YOU COULD
-- NOT HAVE HAD AT ALL. Duplicate element_order and level-jumping-by-more-than-one are
-- inexpressible in a per-element macro, and the second is the rule whose absence caused
-- a year of drift across four extensions -- so every consumer who copied the
-- per-element macro this spec published until 2026-09-01 was unguarded against
-- precisely the defect most likely to bite them.

-- USAGE, and read this before the first call fails.
--
--   SELECT duck_blocks_are_valid(<a LIST(duck_block) expression>);
--
-- If your producer is a TABLE function, DuckDB rejects passing it inline:
--
--   SELECT duck_blocks_are_valid(my_reader('doc.epub'));
--     -> Binder Error: Table function cannot contain subqueries
--
-- Materialise it first:
--
--   CREATE TEMP TABLE b AS SELECT my_reader('doc.epub') AS blk;
--   SELECT duck_blocks_are_valid(blk) FROM b;
--
-- MATERIALISE FIRST, ALWAYS. Do not try to work out whether your producer is exempt.
--
-- This file said "a scalar producer passes inline fine; the restriction is specific to
-- table functions". That was measured -- and measured on THIS repo's producers, which
-- are the ones that happen to work. panduck's producer is also scalar and does NOT
-- work, because what trips the binder is what the producer EXPANDS TO once inlined
-- into a subquery position, not the kind it is declared as. panduck's dispatch runs
-- through `query()`, which rejects a subquery in its argument including one that
-- arrives by macro inlining.
--
-- So the exemption is not knowable from here: it depends on an implementation this
-- file cannot see. An accurate-sounding exemption is worse than none, because it
-- invites exactly the inline call that fails, with an error naming subqueries the
-- caller never wrote.
--
-- Reported twice by the panduck session: once as the restriction, once to correct the
-- exemption I wrote in response to it.
--
-- The macros are `duck_block_is_valid` (one element) and `duck_blocks_are_valid` (a
-- document). The FILE name is not a macro name -- also panduck, who grepped for it.

-- Per-element shape. Covers 4 of the 6 things duck_blocks_validate reports.
-- Declared `kind` values. A LITERAL here until 2026-09-01, which is how the version of
-- this check published in the spec came to enumerate two kinds when three exist -- the
-- instruction that leaves a producer with nowhere to put a document's title. It is a
-- macro now for the same reason the type list is: check_conformance_macro.py compares
-- it against duck_block_kind_names() and FAILS on drift, so the copy cannot rot.
--
-- Kinds and element types are DIFFERENT AXES and both are needed. duckdb_markdown
-- reported a false positive from comparing the type list against the kind names; the
-- file offered only one of the two, so the mistake was available to make.

-- `frontmatter` where the vocabulary declares `metadata` and nothing objected.
--
-- This list is a COPY of duck_block_type_names(), which is the kind of thing that

--
-- Kept SEPARATE from duck_blocks_are_valid deliberately: an unknown type is a LINT, not
-- an invalidity. A consumer built against an older vocabulary must still read data from

-- it would make every additive spec release break every consumer who had not upgraded.
